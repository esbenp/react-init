# react-init

Just a small boilerplate for React apps that I like to use. Based on an ejected create-react-app.

* Flow
* Immutable 3
* Redux 3
* Redux Logger
* Redux Immutable
* React-router 4
* Styled components 2
* Webpack 3

API layer is intentionally left out as I switch between either a REST API or a GraphQL layer.

For REST APIs I like to use:

* [redux-api-middlware](https://github.com/agraboso/redux-api-middleware)
* [redux-refresh-token](https://github.com/esbenp/redux-refresh-token)
